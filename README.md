# Statistics-with-Python-Sample-vs-Population-Metrics
This repository contains Python scripts and examples that demonstrate the fundamental concepts of statistics, particularly focusing on the differences between sample and population metrics. The examples provided cover a range of topics, including mean and variance calculations, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), and confidence intervals.

Contents
1. Mean Calculation
This section provides examples of how to calculate the mean for both a population and a sample using a randomly generated dataset. It illustrates the distinction between the population mean and the sample mean, highlighting how these metrics are derived from the dataset.

Population Mean: Calculated using the entire dataset.
Sample Mean: Calculated using a subset of the dataset.

2. Variance Calculation
This section covers the computation of variance for both the population and a sample. It explains the differences between population variance (using the entire dataset) and sample variance (using a subset of the dataset).

Population Variance: Calculated with degrees of freedom (ddof) set to 0.
Sample Variance: Calculated with degrees of freedom (ddof) set to 1.

3. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
The Central Limit Theorem section demonstrates the principle that the distribution of sample means approximates a normal distribution, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, as the sample size increases. The script repeatedly takes random samples from the dataset, calculates their means, and plots the distribution of these sample means.

4. Confidence Intervals
This part explains how to compute the confidence interval for the sample mean using the t-distribution. It includes an example of calculating the 95% confidence interval for a sample mean, providing insights into the range within which the true population mean is likely to fall.

Usage
To run the examples, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scipy
You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
Each script can be run individually to observe the output and understand the statistical concepts being demonstrated.

Conclusion
This repository serves as a practical guide for understanding and applying fundamental statistical concepts in Python. It is ideal for students, data analysts, and anyone interested in learning more about statistics through hands-on examples.

Feel free to explore the scripts and modify them to deepen your understanding of sample and population metrics in statistics.
